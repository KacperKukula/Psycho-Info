# Psycho-Info
Psycho Info is a site dedicated to gaining knowledge. First of all, the user of Psycho Info is supposed to understand a given issue, through various sources of knowledge (our main goal). The whole structure of the site as well as the search engine is based on a simple and reliable structure of article segregation: on tags. When searching for an article elaborating a given issue, the user is able to segregate the content by them and search by keywords typed in the appropriate place. As a result, the site gives the impression of being clear, consistent and user-friendly (the user knows where he is). This makes acquiring knowledge very easy.
